# Hello-World
# Welcome to Samin Ghousy's Github Page

I am a Systems Analyst student that is motivated to learn new things and adapt to changing technology

During my free time I enjoy spending time with family, staying physically active, and eating sushi. 

Although, I am still new to the world of programming I am up for the challenge to grow and experince new ideas
